This is my Plant Recognition Project , using a model i made from the plant recognition dataset from kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/code/gaborfodor/seedlings-pretrained-keras-models/notebook

A full report of the dataset is provided

This is how to run the project using VSCodee
Step 1: Run app.py 
Step 2: Open another terminal to run react using "cd plant-recognition" and "npm start"
Step 3: i have provided some images to test , the predicted label will be displayed for the images , if you would like more images , use the above link from the kaggle dataset

Thanks a lot
